## Grading Rubrics (FOR MY REFERENCE)
Recall that this is a database systems class and the code that I will grade will be the one related to how you handle 
the data in your database using your bot implementation. This means that I won't grade code that is outside this scope
such as making your bot do things that are not related to this project. 

This milestone is worth 40% of your final grade, and the grade rubrics are detailed here as follow: 

1. If you fail to provide the README file with the info stated in the submission guidelines section, 
your milestone will get the lowest possible grade.
2. If your README file contains a expired Discord link or/and your database is offline by the time the instructor is grading the assignment will affect the student grade negatively.    
2. Your bot must compile and run in repl, connect to your database and after that, it must be online in your Discord server. 
(-30%) will be deducted from your final grade in this milestone if the program does not run or throws non-recoverable errors 
3. Assuming that the program runs and there are not errors, for every business requirement that is not implemented correctly 
then (-2.5%) 
4. In this milestone, you have the option to implement two extra-credit business requirements in your program that must
be previously approved by the class' instructor. (+2.5% each) 
5. Students that incur in Cheating and/or plagiarism will get a zero in this milestone. 


By the deadline of this milestone, students must have the following in their main/master branch of their repositories for 
this milestone.  

1. In the main README (table of assignments) milestone3 must be set to "completed". **No exceptions**
2. Your Discord server must have the following channels ```#general, #commands, and #business-requirements```
2. In this directory, create a new README file and add the following info: 
   1. Your name and student id.
   2. The link to join your Discord Server. Make sure that it doesn't expire. If the link is expired, we cannot grade your assignment.
   3. The invite link to your app hosted in replit.com
   4. It is the responsability of the student to make sure that the database hosted in the remote server of your choice is always online and accessible by the bot. If the database is offline, we cannot grade your assignment. 
   5. The commands the user needs to use so your bot can trigger the right output for your business requirements. Same as the ones you included in    ```#commands```channel
   6. Your business requirements. Same as the ones you included in ```#business-requirements```channel
3. All your code must also be within this directory, and it must be exactly the same code that you have in your
repl app. 
4. If you modified your databasemodel.sql or inserts.sql from milestone 2, then upload the new files to this directory.
